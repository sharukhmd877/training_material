AWS Lambda is a serverless computing platform that allows you to run code without the headache of managing servers, Managing your own servers is a challenging test, hence AWS Lambda comes handy here. You can create a Lambda function by specifying the runtime, the code to execute, and the trigger that invokes the function. 

Creating a Lambda function in AWS: 

1. Navigate to the Lambda dashboard in the AWS Management Console.
2. Click the "Create function" button. 
3. Select the runtime that your code is written in (e.g. Node.js, Python, Java). 4. Enter a name and description for your function. 
5. Choose the type of trigger for your function (e.g. API Gateway, S3, DynamoDB, etc.). 
6. Upload your code to the Lambda function or specify the location of your code (e.g. S3 bucket).
7. Configure the function's execution role and any additional settings as needed. 8. Click "Create function" to create the Lambda function. 

Your Lambda function should now be created and ready to use. You can view and manage your function in the Lambda dashboard, and modify its settings as needed.
